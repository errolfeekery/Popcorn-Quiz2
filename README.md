# Testing

Testing was conducted regularly through developers tools and breakpoints were implemented often in debugging and understanding the flow of information. 

Bootstrap was used for the specific purpose of making a very responsive site and the quiz works very well on browsers of all sizes.

Many different features were tried and abandoned in the process of making the site. Being my first JavaScript project I eventually had to strip back many of the originally intended features as I did not have the knowledge to properly control or implement them properly. I made the error of building the website with bootstrap first and then trying to code in features, leading to spagetti code and four previous iterations of the quiz abandoned. 

### Validator testing

* HTML

    * six errors currently showing, all of which relate to the <meta> tags, none of which I have been able to solve or even locate

* JSHint

    * four minor warnings

### unfixed bugs

Just the single bug I have been unable to remedy
