# Testing

Testing was conducted regularly through developers tools and breakpoints were implemented often in debugging and understanding the flow of information. 

Bootstrap was used for the specific purpose of making a very responsive site and the quiz works very well on browsers of all sizes.

Many different features were tried and abandoned in the process of making the site. Being my first JavaScript project I eventually had to strip back many of the originally intended features as I did not have the knowledge to properly control or implement them properly. I made the error of building the website with bootstrap first and then trying to code in features, leading to spagetti code and four previous iterations of the quiz abandoned. 

### Validator testing

* HTML

    * six errors currently showing, all of which relate to the <meta> tags, none of which I have been able to solve or even locate

* JSHint

    * four minor warnings

### unfixed bugs

Just the single bug I have been unable to remedy

# Credits

With all of my previous attempts to create a success JavaScript quiz lacking functionality I was forced to rely heavily on a stack overflow post about how to set up a basic operational quiz.

[Stack Overflow Quiz](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68116546/how-to-change-javascript-quiz-to-issue-a-pass-and-fail-message-instead-of-score)

What I was able to do was focus on debugging the code and getting it working on my quiz and to ensure that I understood what every line was doing, using breakpoints and console logs. I regret having to use so much of this code and not building significantly on it, but I ran out of time. 

Instructions on how to set up a navbar and showcase with bootstrap was taken from this tutorial
